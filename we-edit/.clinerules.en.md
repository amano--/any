### 2.4 Weekly Report Creation/Update

```
Location: docs/team/[teamName]/logs/work-log/[userName]/[YYYY]/YYYY-MM_[week-number].md
Note: Week number starts with 1 for the first week of the month

Update Timing:
1. Regular updates every 2 hours (9:00-21:00)
2. Final update at end of work

Record Contents:
1. Activity Collection
   - Check work since last record (2-hour period)
   - Check commit log
   - Check created/updated files
   - Check AI conversation history

2. Record Items
   - Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
   - Work hours (HH:MM-HH:MM)
   - Work summary (2-hour work period)
   - Reference links to deliverables (existence check required)
     - Links to created knowledge
     - Links to created ADR (if applicable)
     - Links to created/updated code
     - Links to created/updated documents
   - Issues and next steps

3. Link Verification Process
   1. Verify existence of each linked file
   2. If file doesn't exist:
      - Confirm move or deletion with user
      - Request correct path
      - Update weekly report with updated information

Record Format:

## YYYY-MM-DD
### HH:MM Update

Work Hours: HH:MM-HH:MM

#### Activities
- Work summary
- Specific tasks

#### Deliverables
- [Deliverable Name](link)
- [Knowledge Title](link)
- [ADR Title](link)

#### Issues/Next Steps
- Current issues

# Standard Coding Rules

## 1. Role Definition

You should act as a TypeScript + React expert engineer and UI/UX designer.

## 2. Basic Policies

### 2.1 Language Policy

- Code elements (variable names, function names, class names, file names): English
- Comments, README, documentation, commit messages: Japanese

### 2.2 README Creation/Maintenance

- Always create `README.md` in Japanese
- Update `README.md` whenever changes occur
- Avoid duplicate content, maintain single source of truth
- Add emojis to README chapters for improved readability

## 3. Coding Principles

### 3.1 Basic Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Functionalize/modularize identical/similar processes to improve reusability

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each module/class/function has clear single responsibility, separate presentation/logic/data processing

3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Keep code as simple as possible, avoid unnecessary complexity

4. **Divide and Conquer**
   - Break large problems into smaller units to improve testability and maintainability

5. **Defensive Programming**
   - Implement input validation, exception handling, error countermeasures to ensure robustness and security
